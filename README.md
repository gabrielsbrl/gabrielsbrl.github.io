### Heey 😁

Hi, i'm Gabriel Sobral from São Paulo, Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Developer since 2015, now i'm creating things and solving problems every day as Software Engineer. I really like to work with Javascript based technologies, such as Angular, NodeJS, React, React Native and IoT with arduino and nodeMCU.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) video games (🎮), read any kind of book (📖), solve puzzles, travel (✈) or learn a new language (👨‍🎓)
